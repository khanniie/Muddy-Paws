# PUI Assignment 6

See [Reflection.pdf](Reflection.pdf) for the assignment writeup with lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes.
Because the links don't work (for me at least) in the Github PDF viewer, please either download the PDF or see [the actual document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T8TGbDowWaGaqOTyUWmVK8Y86dafVVSatudvZzJrCLo/edit?usp=sharing) for access to the links.

App built in React. Code can be found in the /src folder.
